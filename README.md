Getting started with Git Hub

Hello fellow... gitters?

My name is Jake, I'm a marketing professional looking to add development to my skillset, starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'm looking really forward to learning react and Ionic to create a PWA for our company that helps loan officers create customizable loan options for their customers.

Until that day,
Jake
